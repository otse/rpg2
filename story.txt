youre in an unknown fantasy setting with unknown forces. your mouse is just hovering over the overworld.

it is presented to you with no overarching meaning that would try to hold any kind of retention. it just exists in this simple form. the overworld that you look at, the tileset of swamp and greenland.

if you don't know heroes, and you never liked rpgs, then this game is an unwelcome contender of your time. how to prevent the intimidating nostalgia of the 90s? not everyone wants to walk thru a swamp and pick up a wooden sword with one damage, to try and fight the warden of the next area. you dont want to start in tutorial land when the game is already oversimplified.

you don't want to visit the temple and talk to the monk. we know that he is religious and wise. he probably sells a healing spell.

the problem is now a multitude of insultingly shallow ideas condensed into something unpresentable. the only way i can imagine something like this working, is when it is actually simple and not overworked. no deep rpg systems. just you and your character walking in this rural fantasy land.

what you're left with is something that lacks self awareness and that tries too hard to be liked. but i am really just a waste of your time. you would have a parody of rpgs and just something incredibly dumb.

if the game is fun it needn't any lore to begin with. most io games work like this.

gameplay loop. you control a hero.
